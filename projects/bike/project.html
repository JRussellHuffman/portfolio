	<h3 class="pop">The Design:</h3>
	<p class="pop">As a daily commuter cyclist I try to follow the mantra “same roads, same rights, same rules”. A cyclist is expected to share the roads with cars, and thus they should have the same tools as cars. This project is about safety. We wanted to create a pair of easily used wearable turn signals for cyclists to increase their visibility on the streets and to better communicate with other vehicles on the road.</p>

	<h3 class="pop">Ideation:</h3>
	<p class="pop">There's a number of cyclist turn signal systems that already exist. <a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~leah/LilyPad/build/turn_signal_jacket.html" target="_blank">Leah Buechley</a> began this conversation with her jacket with turn signals built in using a lilypad arduino. We used her design, as well as a few others, as a launching point for our design. We went with the idea to build the turn signals into what we started calling a tiny backpack. It freed the user from a particular garment. It could be made with adjustable straps to wear over a backpack or over a winter coat. And it's not enough to add to the heat like a jacket does. Plus, we'd still keep the increased visibility of putting the signals on the cyclist's back instead of on the bike. </p>
