	<h1 class="pop">QCi's Live quantum demos</h1>
	<h3 class="pop">Project Summary</h3>
	<p class="pop">As Project Manager and Creative Director, I recently had the opportunity to lead the design of a unique series of interactive demos for a major global consulting firm. The goal was ambitious: create an engaging, hands-on experience that demonstrates how quantum optimization can solve some of the world’s most complex problems—in real time. The result is a permanent installation in the client’s innovation exhibition hall, where visitors can explore the power of quantum computing through live demos, each connected directly to a quantum optimization machine on site.</p>
	<h3 class="pop">A First-of-Its-Kind Installation</h3>
	<p class="pop">Unlike static exhibits or simulations, these demos are live. Each one communicates with a real quantum optimization system—meaning the problems aren't pre-rendered or staged. When a visitor interacts with a demo, it triggers an actual quantum solver, with results returned and visualized on the spot. This kind of real-time demonstration is not only rare but deeply powerful, turning abstract computational theory into something tangible and immediate.</p>
	<h3 class="pop">1. Quantum Machine Learning</h3>
	<p class="pop">This demo explores how quantum optimization can be used to train machine learning models. Visitors can engage with a simplified classification problem and watch as the system solves for feature weights using quantum techniques rather than traditional methods, in comparison to a state of the art classical technique. The underlying principle—mapping a machine learning problem into a quantum energy landscape—becomes clear as users see how feature importance shifts in response to data. It’s an elegant way to demystify both quantum computing and AI, showing how the two can work together to accelerate discovery.</p>

	<h3 class="pop">2. UAS Risk Management</h3>
	<p class="pop">Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) are increasingly used in commercial and governmental operations, but planning their flight paths while managing risk is a formidable challenge. This demo simulates a real-world scenario where drones must navigate constrained airspace while minimizing risk to infrastructure below. Users can select flight paths, and then compare it to a flight path generated and recommended by our quantum optimization technique. The demo makes it easy to see how quantum technology can offer faster, more adaptive planning in high-stakes environments.</p>

	<h3 class="pop">3. Mission Planning</h3>
	<p class="pop">This demo tackles one of the most urgent and complex challenges in modern logistics: how to plan and execute missions in contested environments. These are high-friction, high-risk scenarios—think natural disaster zones, denied territories, or congested supply chains—where resources are limited, priorities shift rapidly, and traditional planning tools struggle to keep up. The demo invites users to set choose between recommended routes based on fuel costs and success probability calculated by the quantum system. It's a clear demonstration of quantum optimization’s value in environments where the stakes are high and decisions must be both fast and flexible.</p>

	<h3 class="pop">4. Financial Planning</h3>
	<p class="pop">In the financial planning demo, users explore uncertainty and risk through a quantum-powered Monte Carlo simulation. By adjusting investment scenarios, timelines, and market volatility, participants can watch how the system evaluates hundreds of possible outcomes in parallel and returns a probabilistic analysis powered by our quantum random number generator (qrng). Rather than just calculating a single expected return, the demo provides a distribution of outcomes, helping users understand and compare different risk profiles. It’s a powerful visualization of how quantum systems can enhance strategic decision-making in finance by accelerating simulations that would otherwise be computationally intensive.</p>

	<h3 class="pop">Designed for Engagement and Education</h3>
	<p class="pop">Because the demos are installed in a high-profile innovation space, the design and storytelling had to be as strong as the technology behind them. As creative director, I ensured that each experience was not only scientifically accurate but visually engaging and user-friendly. We crafted custom interfaces, intuitive user flows, and clear data visualizations to help users understand what the quantum system was doing and why it mattered. Each demo invites curiosity, encouraging participants to ask deeper questions about the future of computing.</p>

	<h3 class="pop">Connected to Reality, Not Sci-Fi</h3>
	<p class="pop">One of the most important parts of this project was keeping the experience grounded. Quantum computing can often feel like science fiction—but this installation proves that the technology is not only real, but already solving real problems. By letting users interact with a live quantum machine and see its results in action, we’ve taken a major step toward making this revolutionary technology understandable and trustworthy.</p>
