	<p class="pop">Homes to Domes, An Exploration in Interactive Heritage Interpretation is the name of my Master’s Thesis Project. In 1988, a group of Booker T. Washington high school students interviewed 13 Vine City residents about the 1992 Georgia Dome. In 2015, the Historic Westside Cultural Arts Council and the Participatory Publics Lab at Georgia Tech interviewed 10 Westside residents about the 2017 Georgia Dome. This exhibit contextualizes these interviews with historical analysis and archival material in collaboration with historian Todd Michney and researcher Katherine Diedrick.

	<h3 class="pop">The Design:</h3>
	<p class="pop">The primary goal of the exhibit is to allow users to interact with the content that has been gathered during the duration of this project. The content includes historical photography, historical news media, oral history videos, and oral history audio.</p>
	<p class="pop">In designing the exhibit, I want to give the user’s a close up view of the content, as well as a zoomed out view, to show the content in a greater context. To do this, I have broken down the content into multiple small screens with the data itself, as well as an aggregate large screen to contextualize the content.</p>
	<p class="pop">In the design of the interaction, I am trying to leverage exploration and a linear storytelling. The final artifact will have a series of themes and filters from which the user can follow a path, but also jump between themes and explore the content in a non-sequentially. The small screens will be what the user has control over, the large screen will show the themes and paths they can explore.</p>

	<h3 class="pop">A Collaborative Effort:</h3>
	<p class="pop">This project was made possible through a unique collaboration between individuals that I am so thankful to have been able to work with. Researcher Katherine Diedrick lead the project as a research initiative, historian Todd Michney helped contextualize the content with historical analysis and archival material, and Dr. Chris Le Dantec  helped found the partnership between Georgia Tech and the westside communities with the Historic Westside Cultural Arts Council lead by Tracy Bates. Thank you to all these people as well as the community members of Vine City and English Avenue for helping make this project a reality.</p>
