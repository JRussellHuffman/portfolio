	<h1 class="pop">Watson Compare & Comply</h1>
	<h3 class="pop">Project Summary</h3>
	<p class="pop">As per the official documentation, IBM Watson Compare and Comply enables understanding of governing business documents with pre-trained models so enterprises can get started in minutes. The document conversion capabilities enable both machine-to-machine and machine-to-human readable formats. The table understanding, element classification and compare capabilities of Compare and Comply enable automation of complex business processes such as contract review and negotiation, invoice reconciliation, software entitlement verification, and more. Such automation of processes will result in increased productivity, minimization of costs, and reduced exposure.

	<h3 class="pop">My role</h3>
	<p class="pop">I was one of two product designers working on Compare and Comply from the initial conception to initial public release (GA). My responsibilities included shaping business goals with technical capabilities to user needs via design thinking methodologies, user research, defining information architecture, wireframing, prototyping, and ultimately generating build ready assets and repeatable components. </p>
	<h3 class="pop">Target audience</h3>
	<p class="pop">There were two primary users for Compare and Comply. They were the lawyers who trained the models, and the lawyers who used the final product. We worked very closely with both parties to define a product that allowed lawyers who were not data scientists to use a tool that was valuable to their needs, both in terms of training a useful model, and ultimately using that model in our tool to compare contracts. My primary focus was on the training aspect of the tooling, but the user experience was largely the same for both users.</p>

	<h3 class="pop">Wireframing and prototyping</h3>
	<p class="pop">Many different iterations and version of the prototype were created over development of this product. The types of prototypes included low fidelity mock ups, to interactive coded prototypes. All prototypes were tested with users for usability.  A pattern was established fairly early on that users primary action for training a document would be to annotate individual sentences for nature, party, and category. Below are a few examples of the various explorations.</p>

	<h3 class="pop">Build ready components</h3>
	<p class="pop">Once our product team had converged on the most ideal user experience for our MVP release, the design emphasis shifted to create repeatable components and assets for the tool. Below are a few screenshots of the hand-off files that were used to build the final products. Note that the below screenshots are not exhaustive and were only used for the initial GA of the product.</p>

	<h3 class="pop">Conclusion</h3>
	<p class="pop">Compare and Comply was a seminal project for me. It helped me find my passion for using my design skills in complex technical spaces such as the intersection of machine learning and law. I saw this project from conception to delivery and was able to bring a user centered approach to the project to distill down the complexity of two highly technical domains into a single product.</p>
