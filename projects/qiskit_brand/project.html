	<h3 class="pop">Project Summary</h3>
	<p class="pop">Qiskit is the largest open source quantum computing community in the world. It is of core important to foster that community and ensure that the community can grow, prosper, and to maintain the image of being a mature quantum computing offering that is community centered. In designing the Qiskit brand, it needed to be a community driven identity. The primary effort in creating this brand book was to take all the pieces and parts that were already serving as a the Qiskit brand values, and formalize them into a single brand book that would be scalable and applicable across all of the Qiskit efforts. Everything written and shown below is a summary of how the brand book was created.</p>

	<h3 class="pop">Capturing the philosophy of the team</h3>
	<p class="pop">Over the past few years, the spirit of Qiskit has been taking shape into a vibrant inclusive community through global events, both physical and virtual. The foundation of the brand book is built on the values established during these events and the work already being done by the global events team. It was important to properly capture their message into the brand book so that Qiskit could scale as the community scales. The following pages are excerpts from the brand book based on interviews, conversations, blog posts, and other material generated by the various parties within the Qiskit community team.</p>

	<h3 class="pop">Establishing visual identity</h3>
	<p class="pop">There had been a handful of efforts to establish a visual identity for Qiskit in the past, but in true open source fashion, much of that identity was scrappy, decentralized, and occasionally contradictory. The visual identity portion of the brand book was an effort to root the visual identity in the brand philosophy as well as the scientific research efforts that happen within Qiskit. It was also a matter of establishing formal design guidelines such as cleaning up the logo, defining logo usage and clear space, and rooting the color palette in the greater Carbon Design System. It was important to maintain the fun and community driven spirit within the visual identity, but keep it related to the IBM Quantum brand and the greater Carbon Design System so that it feels owned by both the open source community and the research efforts happening in IBM.Â </p>

	<h3 class="pop">Visual assets</h3>
	<p class="pop">The Qiskit brand isn't just used internally by IBMers. All brand material is made available to the community as well. In order to insure adoption of the brand work, a series of assets are made available. I defined an illustration style that is repeatable for new asset creation and all current illustrations are made freely available. Relevant Carbon icons and pictograms are included, as well as photography from the various Qiskit events. Guidelines were created for each of these assets to ensure consistent representation.</p>

	<h3 class="pop">Conclusion</h3>
	<p class="pop">Creating a brand for a community driven open source project poses some very unique challenges. But at the end of the day, it is my job as a practitioner of human centered design to listen to the community, understand their values and try to capture it in a single place that will best empower that community to maintain their sense of identity while growing and maturing. The brand book here is an artifact of a much bigger community that I am proud to be a part of.</p>
