	<h1 class="pop">Dollar Bill Buying Power</h1>
	<p class="pop">Money has many uses and abilities, both good and bad. I want to showcase various dualities of the buying power of money. In this case, I am showcasing prosperity and violence on the two sides of the dollar bill. The front side of the dollar shows a city, which I am using to represent the way in which money brings prosperity. The back side of the dollar depicts a helicopter and soldiers, which I am using to represent destruction and violence. Both scenarios exist because we had the buying power to make them happen.</p>

	<h3 class="pop">The Design:</h3>
	<p class="pop">This mini installation on any US $1 is triggered by the app that contains the art piece. By creating and distributing this art piece as a mobile app, the piece can be viewed by anyone anywhere, assuming they have the app and a dollar, without being contingent on location and without defacing or altering US currency.</p>
