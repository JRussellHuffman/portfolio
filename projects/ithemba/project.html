	<h1 class="pop">Mapping iThemba</h1>
	<p class="pop">Mapping iThemba is an interactive map and web narrative that examines pharmacutical production in South Africa. Mapping iThemba has been made possible by a grant from the National Science Foundation program for Science, Technology, and Society (Award #1331049). Professor Anne Pollock did the research and wrote the text for this site, new media artist Katherine Behar conceived the interactive map, and Digital Media master's student Russell Huffman designed, illustrated, and implemented it.</p>

	<h3 class="pop">The Design:</h3>
	<p class="pop">The overarching concept behind the design of the interactive web narrative is to emphasize the material, physical, emplaced presence of scientific knowledge-making in South Africa. The interactive is a part of a larger project which seeks to address “why it matters who makes knowledge and where,” and the web project seeks especially to emphasize the “and where” aspect of this equation.</p>

	<h3 class="pop">Project Needs:</h3>
	<p class="pop">Anne Pollock,  the lead professor on this project is authoring a book about the effects of location on pharmaceutical production. As a part of this project, she wished for an accessible interactive component to be generated that is approachable not just to scholars, but to educators and lay people.</p>
	<ol class="pop">
		<li>an interactive map including zooming, panning, and nodes of information</li>
		<li>an illustration of Johannesburg, Pretoria, and surrounding areas.</li>
		<li>illustrated locations as nodes of information</li>
		<li>icons associated with the various locations</li>
		<li>an interface for the media</li>
		<li>application optimization for web, mobile, and low bandwidth areas such as South Africa</li>
