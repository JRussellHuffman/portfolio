	<h3 class="pop">Project Summary</h3>
	<p class="pop">IBM Quantum as a business unit has many satellite locations. These locations need to consistently represent the IBM Quantum brand. The goal of this project is to enable a conssitent reprsentajtion of IBM Quantum across all locations, including Global Systems Integrators (GSIs), client centers, trade shows, and any other site that represents IBM Quantum in anyway. This includes establishing the overall vision, helping non-IBMers and satellite locations properly represent that brand, create reusable visual assets, and create guidelines around how to create future assets.

	<h3 class="pop">Establishing foundational values</h3>
	<p class="pop">The IBM Quantum brand was largely established prior to this project, but it was unclear how the values of IBM Quantum could be translated and shared in physical spaces. The beginning of this project was collecting all brand material, building a team, and establishing what messaging was most key to disseminate to the rote locations.</p>

	<h3 class="pop">Translate foundational values to a visual palette</h3>
	<p class="pop">Once the foundational values were established, an visual exploration was done to establish a visual identity that captured the brand values. A physical palette of materials was created for use in the design of physical spaces. A print material palette was also create for use in the design of printed assets that would be provided to the client centers.</p>

	<h3 class="pop">Enabling non-IBMers to tell the story</h3>
	<p class="pop">A central goal of this project was maintain a consistent message for everywhere that IBM Quantum was being represented. This is particular hard in remote sites, such as with Global Systems Integrator (GSIs), non-IBM client centers, trade shows, and other scenarios where non-experts would be talking about IBM Quantum and quantum computing generally. To help solve this problem, I designed a field guide that could be easily printed and shared with all remote sites and client centers. Te field guide included information about our users, key messaging, potential applications, and other pertinent information.Â </p>

	<h3 class="pop">Print assets and materials</h3>
	<p class="pop">To coincide with the disseminating the foundational messaging, a series of visual assets that were created to that properly represented IBM Quantum's brand and values. These assets were made available to for remote to use. Many assets already existed in some capacity, such as videos and banners for various events. Part of this effort was reformatting that material to bring it up to band standards. However, net new assets were also created, including the follow example.</p>

	<h3 class="pop">Physical spaces</h3>
	<p class="pop">In some instances, client centers were looking to build out physical spaces dedicated to IBM Quantum. In those instances, we designed a series of recommendations around how to build out that space. The recommendations included recommended print assets and physical materials. Some renderings of these recommendations are the following:</p>
