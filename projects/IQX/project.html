	<h3 class="pop">Project Summary</h3>
	<p class="pop">The IBM Quantum Experience is IBM's cloud based quantum computing software solution for programming and running circuits on quantum hardware. The initial release of the IBM Quantum Experience was in 2016 and was the first ever cloud based quantum computing solution, but was mostly a technical proof of concept. After the success of the initial release, IBM decided to turn the IBM Quantum Experience into a fully scalable software solution.Â

	<h3 class="pop">My role</h3>
	<p class="pop">I was one of two primary product designers working on IBM Quantum Experience from the initial brief of creating a scalable software solution to the first public release (GA). My primary responsibility was working with the quantum researchers and development team to define and build a product that allowed users to program and run quantum circuits using a graphical user interface as well as a cloud based access to our open source SDK Qiskit.</p>

	<h3 class="pop">Users</h3>
	<p class="pop">The users of the IBM Quantum Experience has evolved over time. For the initial release, the primary audiences of the IBM Quantum Experience were learners and experimentalists. The goal was to give access to real quantum hardware to those who didn't have access to a lab. We want students to be able to learn by trying, and researchers to have access to the latest quantum hardware available today.</p>

	<h3 class="pop">Rebuilding for scale</h3>
	<p class="pop">One of the primary goals of updating the IBM Quantum Experience was to create a scalable solution. Quantum computing was (and is) in its infancy. The first release of the IBM Quantum Experience as a proof of concept let users work with 1 quantum system that had 5 qubits and send a single circuit for execution. The new solution has 20+ (and growing) quantum systems with 60+ qubits (and growing). Users can have flexibility in workflow and the software was designed to accommodate for growth in the industry as quantum computers become more useful.</p>

	<h3 class="pop">Wireframing and Prototyping</h3>
	<p class="pop">Below are some examplary wireframes that were used to build the GAed version of the IBM Quantum Experience. These designs layed the foundations for much of the work still happening on the IBM Quantum Experience and although the design of the version available today has a changed, there is still evidence of the impact of these initial designs. Note that with our workflow, multiple designers worked on the same file in parallel and it was often difficult to distinguish the work between design efforts.</p>

	<h3 class="pop">Workflow</h3>
	<p class="pop">This was the first project that I worked on that was fully done in Figma. This is worth noting because it established a new and very clean workflow for our global team. The development team was in Spain, the design team in Austin, and the technical team was in New York. We used Figma and the work being produced by the design team as a central source of truth. It became the primary location for all where the all the various efforts came together.</p>

	<h3 class="pop">Conclusion</h3>
	<p class="pop">The IBM Quantum Experience is a pillar of the IBM Quantum portfolio and the industry leading software available today in the field of quantum information science. This project was an opportunity to introduce user centered design into a field that, up until this project, was exclusively available to scientists, researchers, and laboratories. This project is evidence that the principles of user centered design can be leveraged even in the most emerging and nascent technology fields.</p>
