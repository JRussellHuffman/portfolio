	<h1 class="pop">Qiskit.org web platform</h1>
	<h3 class="pop">Project Summary</h3>
	<p class="pop">Qiskit is IBM's open source quantum computing software development kit (SDK). The primary purpose of the Qiskit.org website is to serve as the source of truth for users to get started using Qiskit and to get involved in the Qiskit community, with the goal of scaling it to a more mature platform. Qiskit is an open source product, and prior to my involvement the website was largely cobbled together in true open source fashion with little coherence or vision for the site.
	<br>
	<br>
	The live site can be found <a href="https://qiskit.org/">here</a>. </p>

	<h3 class="pop">My role</h3>
	<p class="pop">My role on Qiskit.org was (and is) lead designer and creative director. My job was to create a coherent vision and aesthetic as well as to transform it from a website to a platform that will allow Qiskit to scale and mature. Details about the vision and aesthetic can be found in the brand write up. For this write up, I will focus on the Qiskit.org platform and the design decisions made around it.</p>

	<h3 class="pop">Design Research</h3>
	<p class="pop">The initial redesign of Qiskit.org was conducted with the help of a design agency. Before work with them began, I did research with our design research team for the information architecture. We did an open card sort activity that informed the general content structure of Qiskit.org. Below is a summary of the findings from that research.</p>

	<h3 class="pop">User Research</h3>
	<p class="pop">Our Design Researchers team created a comprehensive assessment of IBM Quantum users. This document was used to focus the target audience while updating the Qiskit.org platform. In doing so, it was decided to remove the Qiskit element pages and replace them with a product overview page that would be less technically focused and more appropriate for the audience we saw coming to Qiskit.org.</p>

	<h3 class="pop">The Design</h3>
	<p class="pop">The IBM team was composed of Leron Gil as project manager, Salva De La Puente as lead developer, a myself as lead designer. We established a plan for converging the agency's first round of design concepts with other design efforts that had been in progress for Qiskit.org. The primary goal was to arrive at a single unified Qiskit.org brand, visual ID, and overall experience.

		<br>
With the agency, we setup a schedule of 3 two week sprints which included a sprint kickoff,  weekly check-ins, and a sprint playback. This system evolved throughout our engagement  to give me more working time directly with the agency. The sprint cadence didn't change, but having flexibility within that structure allowed for us to find the best working relationship possible.
	<br>
	<br>
	My engagements were generally the following:
	<ol class="pop">
		<li>detailed redlining of their work during the sprints to check for grid consistency, type hierarchy, and component alignment.</li>
		<li>active working sessions to collaboratively work through the designs concepts</li>
		<li>be a liaison between the qiskit development team, the IBM stakeholders, and the design agency</li>
		<li>enforcing and upholding IBM brand guidelines </li>
	</ol>

	<h3 class="pop">Continued Efforts</h3>
	<p class="pop">After the contract with the design agency expired, I continued driving the design of the Qiskit.org platform, including community pages and documentation.</p>

	<h3 class="pop">Conclusion</h3>
	<p class="pop">This project was my first opportunity take design ownership of the design direction of Qiskit and to show design leadership by giving creative direction to a design agency in order to produce development ready files that leverage the IBM Carbon Design System, and represent the needs of our stakeholders. The designs implemented here are scalable and continue to evolve and grow as the platform grows. </p>
