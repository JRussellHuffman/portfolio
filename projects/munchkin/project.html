	<h1 class="pop">Munchkin Counter Web App</h1>
	<p class="pop">I love the Munchkin card game, but I found it difficult to keep track of levels, gear, and strength without a digital aid. There are apps for mobile and windows, but as a mac user, I didn't really have an option that would allow me to display the whole game board's stats all at once. So I decided to make this app to fix that!</p>

	<h3 class="pop">The Design:</h3>
	<p class="pop">I wanted to create an app that would keep track of levels, gear, and strength for all players during the game. The app allows for up to 6 players (original Munchkin is up to 6 players). Players and names can be easily added or subtracted through the user interface. The aesthetic attempts to match that of the real Munchkin board.</p>
