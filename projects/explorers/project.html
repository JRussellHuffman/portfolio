	<h3 class="pop">The Design:</h3>
	<p class="pop">The project is a phone application where the user can choose to explore with one of the explorers, and follow the prompt direction to walk around an area and discover new lands, just like those explorers did back then. A total of four beacons are used, representing Asia, Europe, Africa and America. When the user gets close to the beacon, the phone app will indicate that the user has arrived in the corresponding continent, and tell the user a little bit about what the explorers did at that place. At each location the user has the option to switch explorers, and choose to explore as another explore, and start an entirely different exploration route.</p>
