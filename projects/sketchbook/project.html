	<h3 class="pop">The Design:</h3>
	<p class="pop">Ron Huffman is a Georgia resident, passionate historian, and pencil artist that has been sketching for over 30 years. Ron decided he wanted a website made that would showcase his work as an artist and also serve as a platform for potentially selling his artworks. The goal in my web design was to create an interface that is virtually transparent, allowing the user to view and interact with Ronâ€™s art with as little interference from web UI as possible.</p>
