	<h3 class="pop">Project Summary</h3>
	<p class="pop">Over the past several years, I am glad to have seen that there is a growing number of online resources for learning quantum computing, some of which I have had a hand in. However, resources for learning and getting starting with <i>quantum optics and nanophotonics</i> are much harder to come by. Over the past 6 months, my team at Quantum Computing Inc (QCi) have been on a mission to change that. Today, I am proud to announce that we at Quantum Computing Inc. are launching a completely rebuilt website that puts education and enablement at its core. From this starting point, we were able to build web infrastructure and a visual identity around our core technology, resulting in something that I believe will help users of all kinds, both new or advanced, understand our novel approach to quantum technologies.

	The website can be found here: <a href="https://www.quantumcomputinginc.com" target="_blank">https://www.quantumcomputinginc.com</a></p>
	<h3 class="pop">Our technology</h3>
	<p class="pop">Before we go further on discussing the creative aspect of building the new website, we should (briefly) establish what our technology actually is. Quantum Computing Inc (QCi) is an integrated photonics company that provides accessible and affordable quantum machines. We make a type of quantum hardware called “Entropy Quantum Computers” that are hybrid analog machine with quantum optics and digital electronics, designed to solve complex optimization problems ranging from binary (qubit) to discrete number (qudit) optimization and beyond. If you want to dive in deeper, I encourage you to visit our learning portion of our website <a href="https://quantumcomputinginc.com/" target="_blank">here</a> (which is the subject of this blog post).
	<br>
	<br>
	To the best of my knowledge there are no other quantum companies making similar hardware, and thus it is very important to communicate what this technology is and how it works.
	<br>
	<br>
	Okay, let’s get back to discussing UX and development.</p>
	<h3 class="pop">The resource library</h3>

	<p class="pop">The first major effort was formalizing a body of knowledge that represented a good entry point. We want our site visitors to be able to learn the core concepts of why our technology is useful, to get started using our quantum machines, and to do productive work. We have several researchers and scientists who have written a significant amount of material, but some key aspects of our story were only in the heads of our experts. The best way to distill the material into a core set of content was to put on my UX Researcher hat and do a series of card sort activities. I am a believer that good UX is agnostic to the subject matter, and well established practices can work as well for quantum computing as anything else. Through several sessions, we mapped out our content and segmented it into 3 core sections.
	<br>
	<br>
		<b>Concepts</b> — high level material that helps build the intuition for a core concept without introducing code
		<br>
		<b>Tutorials</b> — detailed material that includes runnable code on our quantum machines.
		<br>
		<b>Research & publications</b> — white papers and publications that have been published in scientific or academic journals
	<br>
	<br>
	Within each section, we began pulling in content or writing new material that would help site visitors build an intuition for our technology. We ultimately expanded to include spec sheets, use cases, and documentation, and otheres, but those all followed after establishing our “canon”. The most important concepts to communicate are:
	<br>
	<br>
	1. Why photons make for such a powerful foundation of our technology
	<br>
	2. What the difficulties and hurdles in this technology are
	<br>
	3. How these things are physically embodied
	</ul>
	<br>
	<br>
	There are many other important concepts to be communicated that are still in the works, but starting with these three things informed us enough to build the rest of website.
	<br>
	<br>
	As a method of content management, we adopted Contentful partnered with Netlify as a way to quickly and easily create and share content. We ultimately decided to use this as the content management system and foundation for our entire website, as it gave us the flexibility to build and manage pages on a platform that is modern, performant, and easy to use.</p>
	<h3 class="pop">Know thy audience</h3>
	<p class="pop">Our primary objective was making sure scientists and researchers were fully enabled to use the technology that we create. But those were not our only users. After standing up the knowledge base, we needed to make sure our other primary users had the resources they needed. Those users are investors (we are a publicly traded company after all) and business leaders. They needed to be able to understand our technology, but they didn’t need the level of detail that would be required by someone who actually intends to use our technology. For them, it is more important to understand what the future benefit would be and how it could someday change the world. For them, we took the core material in the knowledge base and converted them into offering pages that took a higher level approach to explaining the technology. The Investor Relation portion of the website has its own core set of requirements that are not the subject of this article. But overall, we wanted there to be a consistent experience across our user groups.</p>

	<h3 class="pop">Conclusion and next steps</h3>
	<p class="pop">It sometimes feels weird to be a creative professional working in deeply technical fields. Yet somehow I have spent the last 7+ years in AI, quantum computing, quantum optics, and nanophotonics. The main thing I have learned is that these complicated domains can be made much more approachable when technical experts and creative practitioners work together towards the goal of faithfully communicating the core scientific concepts.
	<br>
	<br>
	At the time of writing this, I have been with QCi for 6 months now, and every day I’m amazed by the new things I learn from the amazing technical talent that I get to work with regularly. At its core, my main goal is to give our researchers and scientists a voice and their work a platform. These first 6 months were largely about establishing good infrastructure. We set up a content management system, a standardized and unified front end, and the beginnings of a visual identity. This year (2024) will be a year of being content focused. Now that we have a good foundation, we intend to create some of the best content for learning and understanding quantum optics and nanophotonics. This field is so often shrouded in misunderstanding that I want to help cut through that noise and let our research and development be shown for the amazing innovations it actually is.
	<br>
	<br>
	I would also be remiss if I didn’t mention my amazing dev team who I worked with everyday to make this project a reality. We are a small but mighty team, and there is nowhere to go but up from here.</p>
