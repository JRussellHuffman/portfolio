	<p class="pop">Giants in The Sky: The Life of a Star is an interactive tabletop installation that explores the role of gravity and mass in the life and death of solar systems and the objects that surround them. With the use of tangibles representing stars of different mass, the installation aims to engage children in astronomy, as well as depict how different objects in a universe such as stars, white dwarfs, black holes, and others come into existence.</p>

	<h3 class="pop">The Interactions:</h3>
	<p class="pop">The primary use experience is creating celestial phenomena by adding stars, comets, and other celestial bodies to the simulation by using tangibles and gestural interactions. The installation makes use of three tangibles, one for a different star size. Users use these tangibles to “stamp” a star onto the table, which spawns a digital star. After stars are created, users are be able to create asteroids and other space debris using flick gestures on the table, which will in turn merge into bigger objects (such as moons or planets) when they collide. All stars, depending on their mass, will turn into a different celestial body (such as black holes and planetary nebulae) once their fuel runs out, giving the users some incite into how stars grow, change, and collapse over their life cycle.</p>
	<p class="pop">As the user populates the table and the more phenomena become present at once, the expectation is for users to experiment with the celestial bodies’ interactions, leading them to the discovery of cosmological concepts supported by small tool-tips with short descriptions. Additionally, users are able to open a pullout that contains the images and descriptions of all the objects that appear in the installation.</p>
