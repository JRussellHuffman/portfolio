	<h3 class="pop">Project Summary</h3>
	<p class="pop">Watson Discovery is a machine learning powered tool that uses natural language processing (NLP) to analysis large corpora of text to generate insights. Over the course of my time working on Watson discovery, I worked on the core product as well as a Salesforce implementation. The core product enables data ingestion and surfaces insights through a graphical user interface. The Salesforce implementation is broadly the same product, but embedded within Salesforce.

	<h3 class="pop">My role</h3>
	<p class="pop">I was a product designer for Watson Discovery primarily focusing on the user experience for data ingestion into our tooling. Machine learning models are only as good as they data they are given and the training provided. My goal was to make it as easy as possible for domain experts to create a model that best fit their specific needs without the direct involvement of a data scientist.</p>

	<h3 class="pop">Target audience</h3>
	<p class="pop">The primary user I was focused on was "Tanya" the trainer. Tanya was defined as a subject matter expert, or domain expert, who was tasked with generating a corpus, feeding it to a machine learning model and then training that model. </p>

	<h3 class="pop">Wireframing</h3>
	<p class="pop">The following images are example wire frames that were design to help users ingest data from various data sources and retrieve insights from that data. Note that not all of the shown wire frames made it into implementation. There was a rather high technical overhead, including working with OAuth, for ingesting data. These wire frames were primarily used for prototyping and testing.</p>

	<h3 class="pop">Conclusion</h3>
	<p class="pop">Working in artificial intelligence is inherently interdisciplinary. The machine learning experts almost always won't be domain experts. The primarily challenge with Watson Discovery, and the thing that made it so exciting to work on, was the goal of trying to make the power of ML accessible to a broad scope of users with a less technical background. User Centered Design is about focusing on the needs of the user, not the technology at hand, and our users needed to be able to leverage nature language processing capabilities without the burden of understanding the data science behind it. </p>
