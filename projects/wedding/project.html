	<h3 class="pop">The Design:</h3>
	<p class="pop">The website needed to not only contain the information for the wedding, but also maintain the same look as the wedding invitations and, when the date arrives, the wedding itself. The website offers all the information guests and wedding party members may need to know about the event in a graphically pleasing and easily navigated way. The entire website and all of itâ€™s information are presented in a single html file that separates each section with parallaxing images. The website is also mobile accessible and maintains all the same features only minus the parallax effect.</p>
