	<h3 class="pop">Project Summary</h3>
	<p class="pop">I was originally hired at QCi to specifically to develop our resource library, including tutorials, lessons, scientific illustrations, and more. However, it became clear very early on that there was a larger opportunity - to develop the company's brand around this body of work to fully espouse honest science communication as a core brand tenant. I approached it with a clear and specific mission: to make complex science understandable, trustworthy, and compelling for both technical and non-technical audiences. In a field as advanced—and often misunderstood—as quantum technology, our brand couldn’t rely on hype or abstract promises. It had to reflect who we really are: a company grounded in real science, building real systems, and solving real problems. Every decision—from typography to tone of voice—was guided by this principle.</p>
	<h3 class="pop">A Brand Built on Clarity and Trust</h3>
	<p class="pop">At the heart of the brand is a commitment to clear, honest communication. We developed a visual identity that prioritizes legibility and precision, using clean typography and a restrained color palette based on scientific publication best practices that supports, rather than distracts from, the content. The goal was never to “dress up” the science, but to let it speak for itself. Whether we’re talking to a physicist or a policy maker, our brand sets the expectation that we’ll meet people where they are—with respect and clarity.</p>

	<h3 class="pop">A Visual Language for Complex Ideas</h3>
	<p class="pop">One of the most impactful aspects of this effort was developing a library of scientific figures and illustrations. These visuals became foundational to how we explain our work, from peer-reviewed publications to keynote presentations. They were designed not just to look polished, but to faithfully represent complex ideas—nonlinearity, entropy computing, quantum optimization—in ways that remain accurate under scrutiny and still intuitive to non-experts. Creating this kind of dual fluency was one of the hardest and most rewarding parts of the project. We bridged the gap between scientific rigor and visual storytelling.</p>

	<h3 class="pop">Extending the Brand into Industrial Design</h3>
	<p class="pop">The brand doesn’t stop at the screen or the page—it extends into the physical form of our products. Our hardware is designed with the same clarity and intentionality that drives our messaging. The industrial design language is clean, modern, and highly considered, reflecting both the sophistication of the technology and the confidence of the brand. But more than just aesthetics, the hardware is expressive: our quantum optimization machine physically embodies the photonic couplers and architecture it houses within. We’ve designed a visual and material language that mirrors what’s happening inside the device—letting the form speak for the function, and inviting deeper understanding through design.</p>

	<h3 class="pop">Showing Up in the World: Trade Shows and Print</h3>
	<p class="pop">In public-facing environments like trade shows, the brand comes to life at scale. From banners and backdrops to printed collateral and hardware displays, we’ve created a full visual system that carries our values into every interaction. Our trade show presence is clean, intelligent, and welcoming—avoiding the sci-fi clichés that often dominate the industry. Posters and brochures are designed with the same care as our scientific figures, ensuring they can communicate both technical content and strategic value. The result is a presence that stands out not by being loud, but by being clear and credible.</p>

	<h3 class="pop">Speaking to Scientists and Investors</h3>
	<p class="pop">Our audience is wide-ranging. On any given day, we may be explaining a novel quantum algorithm to a physics PhD, or introducing our value proposition to a room full of investors. The brand had to flex, without ever compromising on authenticity. We achieved this by building a modular system—both visual and verbal—that could scale across use cases. Scientific decks, investor briefs, product photography, even trade show booths all share a consistent design language that reinforces our credibility. And most importantly, our messaging stays coherent: smart, confident, and honest, no matter who’s listening.

	This wasn’t a cosmetic project. It was strategic—and it paid off. The brand system we built now touches every part of the company’s public presence. It’s helped us publish more effectively, present more clearly, and show up with confidence in spaces ranging from academic conferences to Capitol Hill. And it's had a tangible impact: since the launch of the new brand, our company has raised over $400 million in funding and our stock price has gone from under $1 to over $20 at the time of writing this. That kind of traction comes from more than just good design—it comes from trust. But design helped earn that trust by making our story understandable and believable.</p>
