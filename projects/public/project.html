	<h1 class="pop">Public Development</h1>
	<p class="pop">I am examining and critiquing methods of communication between developers, governmental agencies, and communities on matters of urban development. Specifically, I am looking at how to improve the situation of the underrepresented neighborhoods of English Avenue and Vine City by giving them a better capacity to respond to developments that may adversely affect their community. This project intentionally was explored in the wake of the construction of the new Georgia Dome.</p>

	<h3 class="pop">The Design:</h3>
	<p class="pop">The primary of goal of the application prototype is to offer the same development information present in the Comprehensive Development Plan (CDP) in a way that is easily navigable by the general public as opposed to purely developers. In order to do so, the information is sorted by location (neighborhood planning unit, or NPU) instead of by subject matter like in the original CDP. In other words, the original CDP would lump all of the cities economic development plans and statistics into one document, which may include a few points of data pertinent to each NPU. The app prototype lumps information about each NPU together, which may include a few points of data from each section of the original CDP.</p>

	<h3 class="pop">What I Learned:</h3>
	<p class="pop">Governmental bodies and their systems are complex entities. The material I examined is fractured across several platforms and this is a structural issue from the governmentâ€™s point of view because they have so many different departments with their own systems and agendas.
	
	While it would take serious work to untangle their user experience knots, many people would greatly benefit from some of the revisions proposed by this project.</p>
